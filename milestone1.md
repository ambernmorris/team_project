Roles and responsibilities
Meeting Planning
What is your team's preferred communication method - email, text, bcourse messaging?
# Text, email, Zoom calls
When will your team be holding meetings? How frequently will you meet? Are there times or days that work well for everyone?
# Once a week to every other week; we are already in contact frequently because we have other classes together and have worked together before. Our schedules vary, but typically Wednesday mornings work best for us to meet.
Discuss future non-academic commitments that might affect members' availability.
# Work, life events, partners, vacations. We communicate clearly when we have conflicts. 
Discuss meeting tempo: “checking in” at the beginning of meetings versus “just sticking to business”.
# We like to check-in and then we usually get to work after chatting some. 
How is your team going to keep track of progress? Who will be taking minutes, creating agendas, and contacting the course facilitators with questions?
# We both come to our meetings prepared with questions and a general idea of what we will be working on together. Amber will be the one usually to contact course instructors. 
We encourage you to discuss potential dates and times to meet with a course facilitator during Weeks 3-5. Decide on the best date and time for all.
# We will meet with Lauren on Mondays via private office hour appointment if needed.
Determine a point person to submit each assignment for the team.
# Ileah will do this.
Conflict Management
If a conflict arises, plan to solve the issue as soon as possible. This is best done using synchronous (Zoom, Google Hangouts) communication rather than asynchronous (email).
If the group is unable to resolve the conflict, seek advice from the instructional team. 
# Yes, will do.
Team's preferred communication method

Team's preferred meeting times and frequency
# Once a week to every other week; we take other classes together, so we are in contact often and are always willing to meet whenever. 
Team's preferred method for tracking progress
# We plan to have each milestone finished a week ahead of the due date, so we can make changes if we need to ahead of time.
