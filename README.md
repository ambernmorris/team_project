# This repository and project is through the UC Berkeley MPH program, class 251: R for Public Health.

# The data source is from the California Smokers Cohort (CSC) 2011 through UC San Diego - https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/object/bb6282371f. 
# These data are from a survey designed to investigate factors associated with tobacco quitting behaviors, sponsored/funded by CDPH.
# Through these data, CDPH will better understand tobacco use and behaviors among smokers in California and be able to design an implementation strategies in high-risk communities to increase quitting behaviors. 
# As we go through the milestones, the elements we use may change, but we foresee combining each data set and exploring how race, income, and cigarette brand affect heart disease outcomes. 
# Specifically, creating a visualization to explore how these variables interact with each other and making recommendations to CDPH based on that.
